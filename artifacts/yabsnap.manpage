.SH DESCRIPTION
yabsnap is a btrfs snapshot manager.

.SH GLOBAL OPTIONS

.SS yabsnap -h

View the inbuilt help.

.SS yabsnap ... -h

View the inbuilt help for a particular command.

.SS yabsnap --sync ...

Returns only after all btrfs operations finish.

.SS yabsnap --config-file CONFIG-FILE ...

Use a specified config file, instead of scanning the directory
/etc/config/yabsnap for configs.

.SS yabsnap --source SOURCE ...

Restricts to the config which has the specified source, for example `--source
/home`. The source must be specified in one of the config files. Alternatively,
a config-file directly may also be specified with `--config-file CONFIG-FILE`.

.SH COMMANDS

.SS yabsnap create-config [-h] CONFIG_NAME

Bootstraps a new configuration in /etc/yabsnap/configs/CONFIG_NAME.conf. The
config is an ini file with directives that control yabsnap schedule and
triggers.

Minimally after the config is created, the source and dest_prefix must be filled
in by editing the file manually.

.SS yabsnap list [-h]

Lists all existing snapshots managed by yabsnap.

.SS yabsnap list [-h]

Machine readable lists of all snapshots managed by yabsnap. With bash, this may
be piped into jq for further filtering or restructuring.

.SS yabsnap [--dry-run] [--sync] create [-h] [--comment COMMENT]

Creates a new backup for all configs. Can be disabled per config by setting
`keep_user = 0`.

.SS yabsnap [--dry-run] [--sync] delete [-h] TARGET_SUFFIX

Deletes a snap. You can either specify full path to snapshot, e.g. `yabsnap
delete /.snapshots/@root-20221006183032`, or specify just the suffix, e.g.
`yabsnap delete 20221006183032`. If you specify just the suffix, it will delete
matching snapshots from all configs.

.SS yabsnap [--dry-run] rollback-gen [-h] TARGET_SUFFIX

Generates a script to roll back to a particular snapshot.
